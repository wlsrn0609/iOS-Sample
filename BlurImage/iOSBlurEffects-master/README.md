### Tuts+ Tutorial: Adding Blur Effects on iOS

#### Instructor: Sandeep S Kumar

With iOS 7, we saw a shift in Apple's design paradigm for mobile devices. Not only did they adopt the so-called flat design, Apple also added a few elements to this pattern themselves. One of these additions is the use of blurred-translucent backgrounds to convey the notion of depth and context. Take Control Center for instance, it blurs the contents of the view behind it as it gets pulled up. This gives the user the sense that it is positioned above other content on the screen and deserves focus. It does so without making the user lose track of where she is in the app.

Even though blur and translucency are used throughout the operating system on iOS 7, the iOS SDK doesn't provide us with any APIs to achieve a similar effect. In this tutorial, I'll walk you through a few methods to create blurred views by creating the sample app shown below.
